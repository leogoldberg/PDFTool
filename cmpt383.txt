Topic Idea: 
A web app that allows users to draw a table and have it converted to latex code. The front end app will be written in react, the backend will be a Rust server which executes python scripts to generate the latex code.

3 Programming languages: 
Rust 
JavaScript (React)
Python (PyLaTex)

Inter-language communication methods:
Rest API: Javascript frontend -> Rust Backend
Script Execution: Rust backend -> Python 

Deployment Technology: Docker containers
